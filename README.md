## problem : 
Every day in our daily life, we face many events and problems, and each of us wants to search for the easiest and fastest ways to solve these problems.
One of these problems is the loss of personal belongings somewhere, and these things do not have any means of accessing them.
Another problem that you may face while spread of the Corona virus is exchanging things between hands, such as when you are in a restaurant or café and want to take a menu, so this may cause a danger to us because we do not know how many people used this menu before and was he infected or not !
We may face another problem, which is that someone left his car somewhere, and this car caused a problem such as disrupting someone else’s movement, in this case we cannot reach the owner of this car , and many other problems will come to mention later .

## Solution :
Our project is a solution to such problem ,As it allows the user the ability to create his own QR code, and by this code, it is easy to reach this user , as he can put it on his belongings , or inside the resturant / café , or on the front of the car to solve the problems that were previously mentioned . The solution to the problem is that by scanning this qr code, anyone can reach the other party very easily and quickly.
Without overthinking it, our Team sat down over the following days and created an app that generates car tags with QR codes that owners can place on their rear view mirrors or dashboards, similar to a parking or disabled tag, and that someone can scan to message them in case of an emergency, without revealing their phone numbers to each other.

## Aim of project:
- Safe personal things of users from lost.
- Easy and quick access to the destination.
- Avoid spreading diseases transmitted through touch.
- Help the owner of any organization to collect feedback from the customers.
- QR codes on bus stops and train stations.
- Posted next to paintings and sculptures at museum.
